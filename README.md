# EV Charging Station Maintenance System Prediction

This project aims to enhance the reliability and efficiency of EV charging stations by predicting their maintenance needs. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the system can forecast potential faults and schedule maintenance proactively, thereby minimizing downtime and ensuring a seamless charging experience for users.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/badflametarun/ev-charging-maintenance-prediction.git
    cd ev-charging-maintenance-prediction
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare the data:
    - Ensure the `charging_stations_data.xls` file is placed in the `data/` directory.

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    - Open `notebooks/maintenance_prediction.ipynb` and execute the cells to preprocess the data and train the model.

## Deployment

To deploy the prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Save the trained model:
    - Ensure the model is saved to a file after training in the Jupyter Notebook.

2. Create a web service:
    - Use a web framework like Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit to create an API endpoint for making predictions.

3. Deploy the web service:
    - Deploy the web service to a cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Heroku.

4. Make predictions via the API:
    - Send HTTP requests to the API endpoint with the necessary input data to receive predictions.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.
