# EV Charging Station Maintenance System Prediction

This project aims to predict the maintenance needs of EV charging stations using machine learning techniques. The prediction model is built using data from an IPython Notebook (`.ipynb` file) and an Excel spreadsheet (`.xls` file).

## Project Structure

- `data/`
  - `charging_stations_data.xls`: Contains historical data on charging station usage and maintenance records.
- `notebooks/`
  - `maintenance_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, preprocessing, and model training code.
- `src/`
  - `model.py`: Script for training and evaluating the prediction model.
  - `predict.py`: Script for making predictions using the trained model.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/badflametarun/ev-charging-maintenance-prediction.git
    cd ev-charging-maintenance-prediction
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare the data:
    - Ensure the `charging_stations_data.xls` file is placed in the `data/` directory.

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    - Open `notebooks/maintenance_prediction.ipynb` and execute the cells to preprocess the data and train the model.

## Deployment

To deploy the prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Save the trained model:
    - Ensure the model is saved to a file after training in the Jupyter Notebook.

2. Create a web service:
    - Use a web framework like Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit to create an API endpoint for making predictions.

3. Deploy the web service:
    - Deploy the web service to a cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Heroku.

4. Make predictions via the API:
    - Send HTTP requests to the API endpoint with the necessary input data to receive predictions.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.
